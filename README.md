The dataset contains various factors that contribute to a person's lifestyle. Your task is to build a model that uses these factors to predict whether a person is leading a 'healthy' lifestyle or not. The training set contains 25,920 rows, including whether a person's lifestyle is healthy or not. Use this to train an ML model, then predict whether the 6,480 people in the testing set are leading a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle.

Note: In the target variable, 1 means 'healthy' lifestyle, and 0 means 'unhealthy' lifestyle.
